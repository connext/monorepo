/**
 * @dev The optimism bridge shares both of these functions, but it is important
 * to note that when going from L2 -> L1, the message cannot be processed by the
 * AMB until the challenge period elapses.
 *
 * HOWEVER, before the challenge elapses, you can read the state of the L2 as it is
 * placed on mainnet. By processing data from the L2 state, we are able to "circumvent"
 * this delay to a reasonable degree.
 *
 * This means that for messages going L1 -> L2, you can call "processMessage" and expect
 * the call to be executed to pass up the aggregate root. When going from L2 -> L1, you
 * must read the root from the L2 state
