/**
 * @title ProposedOwnable
 * @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism,
 * where there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 * can later be changed via a two step process:
 * 1. Call `proposeOwner`
 * 2. Wait out the delay period
 * 3. Call `acceptOwner`
 *
 * @dev This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
 * modifier `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict
 * their use to the owner.
 *
 * @dev The majority of this code was taken from the openzeppelin Ownable
 * contract
