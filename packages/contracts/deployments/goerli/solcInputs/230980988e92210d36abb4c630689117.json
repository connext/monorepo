Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their \n///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing \n///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and \n///         price range.\n///\n///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be \n///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` \n///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This \n///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon \n///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, \n///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the \n///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of \n///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending \n///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the \n///         transaction.\n///\n///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the \n///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a \n///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may \n///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` \n///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the \n///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users \n///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving \n///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the \n///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, \n///         unlocking the original `amount`.\n///\n///         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it \n///         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on \n///         each chain (initiator).
